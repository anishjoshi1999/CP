Introduction
------------

Competitive programming is a challenging and exciting field that involves solving algorithmic problems within a limited time frame. This repository aims to provide a platform for you to practice and improve your problem-solving abilities on popular competitive programming websites.

By participating in competitive programming contests and solving problems from various platforms, you can:

-   Develop a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms.
-   Improve your problem-solving skills and optimize your code.
-   Learn new programming techniques and algorithms.
-   Enhance your logical and analytical thinking abilities.
-   Gain experience in working under time constraints.

Repository Structure
--------------------

The repository is organized as follows:


CP/<br>
├── CodeChef/<br>
├── LeetCode/<br>
├── HackerRank/<br>
├── Other/<br>
└── README.md`

-   The CodeChef/ directory contains solutions to problems from CodeChef contests and practice sections.
-   The LeetCode/ directory contains solutions to problems from LeetCode's online platform.
-   The HackerRank/ directory contains solutions to problems from HackerRank contests and practice sections.
-   The Other/ directory is for problems from other competitive programming websites or coding competitions.
-   The README.md file provides information about the repository and serves as a guide for contributors and users.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CP.git`

2.  Navigate to the specific platform directory (e.g., CodeChef/) and choose a problem you want to solve.

3.  Write your solution to the problem in a programming language of your choice. You can create a new folder for each problem or organize them in any way that suits you.

4.  Include the problem statement as comments in your code or create a separate markdown file to describe the problem.

5.  Test your solution using sample inputs and ensure it produces the correct output.

6.  Once you are satisfied with your solution, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

7.  Repeat steps 2-6 for other problems you wish to solve.

Problem Solutions
-----------------

This repository encourages contributors to share their problem solutions and collaborate with others to improve their solutions. You can find solutions in various programming languages and algorithms implemented by different contributors.

To contribute your problem solutions:

1.  Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2.  Create a new branch for your contributions:

    `git checkout -b feature/add-solution`

3.  Add your solution file(s) to the relevant directory based on the platform and problem.

4.  Include comments in your code to explain the approach, algorithm, and any relevant information.

5.  Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

6.  Submit a pull request, and your contributions will be reviewed and merged if they meet the guidelines.
